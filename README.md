# AssetMappr-FE

## About this app
This is a web application developed by Carnegie Mellon University students, for use in community asset mapping. Asset mapping is a systematic process of cataloging key services, benefits, and resources within the community. This includes institutions such as schools/hospitals, physical space, key local businesses, and anything else the community might consider an "asset". Communities need asset mapping in order to plan smartly for their future sustainability and growth. 

AssetMappr is organized by each community, and has three broad functions:
1. Populate a base set of assets to the database by querying several online sources (e.g. Google Maps API, national education and healthcare facility datasets)
2. Take community input through the app on various aspects. E.g., what is missing in the community, what do people really value, etc.
3. Make this information easily usable for planners in their decision-making and proposal-writing processes

We are currently piloting the app with town planners and municipalities in Southwestern Pennsylvania.
